# Getting Started in RimWorld

Welcome to RimWorld! This guide will help you survive your first few days on the rim and establish a thriving colony.

## Choosing Your Scenario

When starting RimWorld, you'll have several scenario options:

- **Crashlanded**: Three colonists with basic supplies (recommended for beginners)
- **Rich Explorer**: One colonist with advanced equipment
- **The Tribe**: Five tribal colonists with primitive technology
- **Lost Tribe**: Fifteen tribal colonists (challenging for beginners)

## Landing Site Selection

Choose your landing site carefully:

- **Temperate Forest**: Ideal for beginners - moderate climate, plenty of wood and animals
- **Arid Shrubland**: Hot and dry, but manageable
- **Avoid**: Ice sheets, deserts, and extreme biomes until you're experienced

## Day 1 Priorities

### Immediate Actions

1. **Pause the game** (Space bar) - Take time to assess your situation
2. **Check your colonists' skills** - Assign roles based on abilities
3. **Claim the survival meals** from the crash site
4. **Set up basic zones**:
   - Home area around your initial location
   - Stockpile zone for items

### Essential First Structures

Build these in order of priority:

1. **Sleeping spots** - Place indoors or under roof
2. **Research bench** - Start researching immediately
3. **Simple meals cooking spot** - Convert raw food to meals
4. **Basic defenses** - Sandbags or walls facing likely raid directions

## Essential Early Game Tips

### Food Management

- Hunt animals for meat (rifles work best)
- Gather berries when available
- Plant rice or potatoes as soon as possible
- Always cook raw food - it's more nutritious and lasts longer

### Colonist Happiness

- Build tables and chairs for eating
- Create bedrooms with beds (not sleeping spots)
- Keep the base clean
- Maintain comfortable temperatures

### Research Priorities

1. **Electricity** - Unlocks many quality-of-life improvements
2. **Air Conditioning** - Temperature control is crucial
3. **Hydroponics** - Reliable food production
4. **Machining** - Advanced crafting options

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Don't Do These Things

- Never leave food outside - it will rot or attract animals
- Don't ignore colonist moods - unhappy colonists cause problems
- Don't build everything out of wood - fire spreads quickly
- Don't neglect defenses - raids will come eventually

### Do These Things

- Save frequently (especially before major decisions)
- Use the pause button liberally to plan
- Read all tutorial messages
- Experiment in a safe environment

## Your First Week Goals

By the end of your first week, you should have:

- [ ] Secure food supply (hunting, gathering, or farming)
- [ ] Basic shelter with beds and tables
- [ ] Research bench actively researching
- [ ] Some form of defense (walls, traps, or positions)
- [ ] Temperature control (campfire for warmth, fans for cooling)
- [ ] Clean, organized base layout

## Dealing with Threats

### Raiders

- Use natural chokepoints
- Build killboxes with traps
- Position colonists behind cover
- Have a retreat plan

### Wild Animals

- Don't hunt predators unless necessary
- Be careful during manhunter packs
- Use doors to control animal movement

### Weather

- Build roofs to prevent deterioration
- Use campfires or heaters for warmth
- Fans or coolers for heat relief
- Store flammable items away from heat sources

## Next Steps

Once you've survived your first week:

1. Expand your base with proper rooms
2. Set up dedicated workshops
3. Recruit more colonists
4. Develop specialized roles for each colonist
5. Plan for long-term sustainability

## Conclusion

RimWorld can be overwhelming at first, but take it slow and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Each colony is a learning experience, and even failures can be entertaining stories.

Remember: the goal isn't just to survive, but to create interesting stories. Embrace the chaos and enjoy the narrative that emerges from your colony's struggles and triumphs!
